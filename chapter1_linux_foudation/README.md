As a result, the Linux Foundation today hosts far more than Linux; 
it is the umbrella for many critical open source projects that power corporations today, spanning virtually all industry sectors.

The Foundation hosts hundreds of the world's most important open source projects including Linux, Kubernetes, Node.js, Hyperledger, ONAP, Cloud Foundry, Yocto, GraphQL, Jenkins, and many more.

I am using github code space that provide me the Ubunto.

## three major Linux distribution families

1. Red Hat Enterprise Linum (RHEL)

including CentOS, CentOS Stream, Fedora, Oracle Linux

2. SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (SLES)

3. Debian

The Debian distribution is upstream for several other distributions, including Ubuntu.

*Ubuntu has been widely used for cloud deployments.

## summary

- The Linux Foundation is the umbrella organization for many critical open source projects that power corporations, spanning all industry sectors. Its work today extends far beyond Linux, fostering innovation at every layer of the software stack.

- The Linux Foundation training is for the community and by the community. Linux training is distribution-flexible, technically advanced, and created with the leaders of the Linux development community.

- There are three major distribution families within Linux: Red Hat, SUSE and Debian. In this course, we will work with representative members of all of these families throughout.
